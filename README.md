# Basic-Math

In this lab you will practice basic math operations in C++. First you will review a program that demonstrates the
use of basic math, then you will write your own C++ code that uses basic math. 

DateableAge = 7 +YourAge / 2

The lab_example.cpp program calculates the lowest dateable age for a given person's age. Open this program in a C++ IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Read and understand the code and run the program. Try changing the given age to see the dateable age for different ages.

In this program you will calculate your magic number. Your magic number is calculated by multiplying the month of your birth by the year of your birth and taking the modulus of that result and the day of your birth. The equation is:

MagicNumber = (month * year) % day

Test:
The magic number for 1-31-1970 is: 17
Please enter your birthdate as 3 whole numbers (MM DD YYYY): 9 14 1991
The magic number for 9-14-1991 is: 13
